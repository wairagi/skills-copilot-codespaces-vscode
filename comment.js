// Create web server
// Create a web server that listens on port 3000 and serves the following HTML file. The file should be created as a separate HTML file and served by the web server.


// <!DOCTYPE html>
// <html>
// <head>
//   <title>My Comment</title>
// </head>
// <body>
//   <h1>My Comment</h1>
//   <p>This is my comment.</p>
// </body>
// </html>
// The server should respond with the above HTML file when a GET request is made to the root URL. The HTML file should be created as a separate file and should not be embedded in the server code.
